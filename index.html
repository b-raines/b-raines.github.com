	<article id="about">
		<p>My name is Brent Raines. I went directly into the navy after high school and was a Reactor Operator on a submarine for 6 years. After getting out, I started working as an Instrumentation and Control technician at Seabrook Power Station and have been there for over a year. I started learning to code in December and quickly realized that I couldn't tackle learning HTML, CSS, javascript, Ruby, PHP, etc. all at the same time. I also discovered that I enjoyed the front-end development a lot more than anything else. I randomly came across Startup Institute on the internet and decided to try the RampUp program. I plan on trying to get into SIB full time after a couple of months at RampUp and diving full force into front-end development. I want to gain as much experience as possible working for startups so that one day I can run a successful company of my own.
